# Celo Network Re-enablement Guide

## Overview

Celo networks have been temporarily disabled to focus on Solana Devnet implementation. This guide explains how to re-enable them in the future.

## Re-enablement Steps

1. **Update Database Configuration**

   ```sql
   UPDATE networks SET is_active = true WHERE network_family = 'evm';
   ```

2. **Verify Environment Variables**

   - Ensure all CELO\_\* variables are configured
   - Verify Celo RPC endpoints are accessible

3. **Test Network Connectivity**

   ```bash
   npm run test:connection
   ```

4. **Update Event Listeners**
   - Ensure both EVM and Solana listeners work together
   - Test multi-network event processing

## Preservation Status

- ✅ All Celo service code preserved
- ✅ Database schema supports both network families
- ✅ Environment variables maintained
- ✅ Tests preserved (currently disabled)

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Celo Configuration
CELO_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_TESTNET=0xE68cf67df40B3d93Be6a10D0A18d0846381Cbc0E
CELO_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xf8C832021350133769EE5E0605a9c40c1765ace7
CELO_ARBITRATOR_ADDRESS=0x6d2dAaA22a90AC8721D1f9C207D817AB7C490383
CELO_PRIVATE_KEY=0xb9daa9a777bffc9596616a7e7dd857cb7db056a57bf4e27031aa2f14bb72436e
```

## Testing After Re-enablement

1. **Start the API**

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

2. **Check Health Endpoint**

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3011/health
   ```

3. **Verify Network Status**
   - Both EVM and Solana networks should be active
   - Event listeners should start for both network families

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise after re-enablement:

1. **Disable Celo Networks**

   ```sql
   UPDATE networks SET is_active = false WHERE network_family = 'evm';
   ```

2. **Restart API**
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

## Notes

- Celo networks are currently disabled (`is_active = false`)
- All Celo service code is preserved and functional
- Database schema supports both EVM and Solana networks
- Event listeners are network-family aware
